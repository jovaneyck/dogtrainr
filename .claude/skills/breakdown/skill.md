# Break down work into subtasks

* As input you are given a spec like "03/spec.md" that lists tasks.
* Do NOT examine the code base to work out task details, we are just splitting a spec file into subtask files.
* Break the spec into tasks and write them each subtask in a markdown file like "03/tasks/01-first-subtask.md"
