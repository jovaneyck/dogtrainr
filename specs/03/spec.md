# Profile picture size

The profile picture size on the dark profile is the actual size of the image. Please scale it so it fits on my monitor width and height. Use a responsive design so it will also work in an app.

# Training plan visualization

The training plan as it is visualized in the plan view and in the dog prof profile view looks different. Please create a single component based on the training plan page and reuse that component in both pages.rework all tests so uh we don't do any duplicate testing and so the component gets tested in isolation
