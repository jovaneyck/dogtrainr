# Dog details screen: inline progress view

- Remove the plan overview and the progress button from the dog details page.
- Directly render the progress view in the dog details page where the plan is currently rendered (this is the more important view; plans are accessible on the toolbar).
- Keep a section at the bottom of the dog details page with:
  - A button to jump to the dog's currently active plan
  - The unassign button (as it is now)
- The "no plan assigned" state should remain the same (where you can select a plan to assign).
