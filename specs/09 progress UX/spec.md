# Modal falls of screen

![](./modal%20falls%20of%20screen.png)

Look at the image, the modal is off-center which makes the save button inaccessible. Fix by centering the modal.

# No quick access to "today" in the progress view

in the /progress ui, I can select a date and it defaults to today, but I want a quick way to navige back to it. add a "today" button

# /progress Score input should be slider not 10 buttons

This is better UX on smartphones

# Dog details screen improvement

get rid of the plan overview and the progress button, instead directly render the progress view in the dog details page where the plan is currently rendered. This is the more important view and plans are accessible on the toolbar.

Do keep a section on the bottom of the dog details page that contains a button to jump the dog's currently active plan + the unassign button as it is now. "no plan assigned"state should remain the same where you can select a plan to assign
