# Progress Reports
So I want to build a new screen. So that's a fourth menu item. And it's called "progress". And I want to be able to select one of my dogs. After selecting a dog, I want to see a list of all the trainings. So not the plans, but the individual trainings. For this dog we have sessions on that have been completed or skipped. And then I want to see in that progress view a graph for the training I selected. And that's plotting all the progress data. So if a session has been completed, it's a black dot. And the y-axis of the dot is the score, and I want smooth lines, and I want to use D3JS, just a line graph, something like that. And if the session was skipped, then I just want it grayed out, so uh a lighter uh color. And I want to track that for every session. provide a filter from and to uh it should default to uh everything all the sessions we have for that dog, uh but I would like to be able to look at like uh a year in total, a month in total, a week in total, stuff like that.
