# Dog Training Plan Does Not Allow Click Through to Training Details

## Status: COMPLETED

## Problem
In a dog's training plan view, the individual trainings listed are not clickable — there is no way to navigate to the training detail page from the plan.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each training listed in a dog's training plan is a clickable link
- Clicking navigates to the individual training's detail page (`/trainings/:id`)
- All tests pass
- Code compiles
