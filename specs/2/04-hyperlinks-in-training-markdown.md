# Hyperlinks in Training Markdown

## Status: PENDING

## Problem
In the training markdown, hyperlinks to external websites (e.g. https://www.youtube.com) are not working. They need to function exactly like standard `<a href>` tags on a web page.

## Acceptance Criteria
- External hyperlinks in training markdown open the target URL correctly
- Links behave exactly as standard HTML anchor tags
- Internal app navigation continues to work
- All tests pass
- Code compiles
